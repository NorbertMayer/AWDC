        <articleContents><![CDATA[<p id="bf8c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Here are a few reasons why React has become so popular so quickly:</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li id="f044" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Working with the DOM API is hard. React basically gives developers the ability to work with a virtual browser that is more friendly than the real browser. React’s virtual browser acts like an agent between the developer and the real browser.</li>
<li id="3a46" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">React enables developers to declaratively describe their User Interfaces and model the state of those interfaces. This means instead of coming up with steps to describe transactions on interfaces, developers just describe the interfaces in terms of a final state (like a function). When transactions happen to that state, React takes care of updating the User Interfaces based on that.</li>
<li id="10e3" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">React is just JavaScript, there is a very small API to learn, just a few functions and how to use them. After that, your JavaScript skills are what make you a better React developer. There are no barriers to entry. A JavaScript developer can become a productive React developer in a few hours.</li>
</ul>]]></articleContents>

        <articleContents><![CDATA[<p>Back in 2007, the world met the iPhone for the very first time. After Apple’s product debut, it took less than six months for work to begin on PhoneGap, which would become one of the first and most adopted frameworks for hybrid mobile app development — that is, for apps written simultaneously for multiple platforms using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, rather than coded in native languages.</p>
<p>When compared with the prospect of learning an entirely new language and development environment in order to program iOS (and soon Android) apps, the appeal of this type of development to the already huge population of web developers in the world was palpable.</p>]]></articleContents>

The Heart Disease Prediction application is an end user support and online consultation project. Here, we propose a web application that allows users to get instant guidance on their heart disease through an intelligent system online. The application is fed with various details and the heart disease associated with those details. The application allows user to share their heart related issues. It then processes user specific details to check for various illness that could be associated with it. Here we use some intelligent data mining techniques to guess the most accurate illness that could be associated with patient’s details. Based on result, the can contact doctor accordingly for further treatment. The system allows user to view doctor’s details too. The system can be used for free heart disease consulting online.</span></p>]]></projectContent>

For making strong relationship with these users it is very important to focus on the customer as a whole and making sense of a flood of real-time information that goes well beyond demographics or shopping behavior.

Admin can add product details, view all the order details and can also view the sales of the products. User need to register with basic registration details to generate a valid username and password. After the user logins, it can view all the products that are recommended on the homepage compiled by the system based on user’s information. From the recommended products, the user can even further view its details and then if interested to buy, the system gives add to cart option for purchasing the product. The system even has an AI bot with the help of which the user can get answers to queries like features, warranty, price etc. details of the products. This AI Bot even converts text to speech. After selecting the product, user can do payment for the particular product online. Users can view their order history of their purchased product.</span></p>]]></projectContent>

        <projectContent><![CDATA[<p><span>Modern day-to-day life of people in major cities is very demanding and the schedules are equally hectic. In such times, it is practically impossible to keep a track of all the activities/ appointments. Many a times, it happens that we may miss an important task; for example: taking medicines, attending a meeting, returning library books, paying the bills etc. And this cycle can keep going on endlessly. The human mind is not designed to multitask, it needs to work things out one at a time. This requires us to maintain our focus on the task at hand, and as a result other important things take a backstage and some may even slip out of our minds. In order to address this problem, we have come up with a Weekly Task Alerting System. This system is designed to alert the user of all the important tasks that are due on a specific day, every week. So now, the user can carry on with his/her life without any worries. The developed project is a tasks reminder app, with AI-powered Chatbot that will make user enjoy productivity. Whether your goal is to make good habits or get rid of bad ones. This application helps you to make sure that the tasks you set actually get done, with the help of its AI assistant. It monitors your android phone, pings you at times you’re likely to see a notification and makes sure you don’t forget about items on your to-do list. With this, which is one of the bot characters, this app brings you not only your tasks reminder but also a free productivity assistant that engages you throughout the day to create a more productive version of yourself.</span></p>]]></projectContent>
